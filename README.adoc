for *ME*. It's a sanctuary where every keystroke feels intuitive, every plugin
seamlessly integrated, and every aspect finely tuned to cater *ME* unique
workflow.

* *Zig Compiler*: For compiling treesitter languages in Windows
* *git*: Git CLI
* *ripgrep*: For live grep

== üöÄ Installation

=== üêß Linux

* Dependency: *GCC*

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/MidHunterX/HunterX-PDE '~/.config/nvim' --depth 1 && nvim
----

=== ü™ü Windows

* Dependency: *Zig Compiler*

[source,cmd]
----
git clone https://github.com/MidHunterX/HunterX-PDE %%localappdata\nvim --depth 1 && nvim
----

== üòá Behaviours

Yank into System Clipboard::
Less hastle when copy pasting between windows frequently.

Highlight Yanked Text for 150ms::
Quickly know how much text got yanked when using direct yank commands.

Scroll past EOF in buffer with `j`::
Personal preference for EOF to not be stuck at the bottom of the screen.

Show Relative Line Number on Normal Mode::
That's the only time you need Relative Line Numbers for Jumping Lines.

Show Normal Line Number on Insert Mode::
Useful when doing substitution based on line numbers.

== üìù Autocompletion Behaviour

* Autocompletion suggestions keep popping while typing
* If the suggestion box is visible, you can do the following
* Select Next entries with: `TAB`, `C-n`
* Select Previous entries with: `S-TAB`, `C-p`
* Accept an entry with `CR` / `RET`
* Cancel Completion with `C-e`

ü§î Maybe VSCode like `DOWN` to select and `TAB` to complete might be better?

== üõÇ Custom Features

* Toggle Boolean Values with `C-a`
* Trim trailing lines and Write Buffer with `<leader>w`
* Git add . + commit -m with `<leader>gc` (Replaced with Lazygit)
* Execute files with `F5` or `:lua Execute_order_69()`
* Run file formatter with `<leader>fm` or `:lua Run_formatter()`
* Convert text to Hit Font with `:HitComment`
