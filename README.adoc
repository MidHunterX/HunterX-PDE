=== 🕺💃 Bracket Auto Pairs (nvim-autopairs)

Autocloses these Brackets and Quotes: '{', '[', '(', '"', '\''

=== 🪨 Auto Disable Features on Big Files (bigfile.nvim)

Automatically disables certain features if the opened file is big (1MB).

Disabled Features: `indent_blankline`, `illuminate`, `lsp`, `treesitter`,
         `syntax`, `vimopts`, `filetype`

=== 🎨 Colorschemes

The following colorschemes are included:

Low memory usage. dashboard does not store the all user configs in memory like
header etc these string will take some memory. now it will be clean after you
open a file. you can still use dashboard command to open a new one , then
dashboard will read the config from cache.

=== 🔧 Language Server Protocol

A language server is a specific kind of tool. Usually they are command line
tools that implement the LSP specification. Long story short, the language
server analyzes the source code in your project and tells the editor what to
do.

mason.nvim and mason-lspconfig.nvim manages the installation of the language
servers from inside Neovim, and then lspconfig to configure the language
servers.

==== 🔨 LSP Manager (mason.nvim)

Portable package manager for Neovim to easily install and manage LSP servers,
DAP servers, linters, and formatters.

mason.nvim is a Neovim plugin that allows you to easily manage external editor
tooling such as LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters through a
single interface. It runs everywhere Neovim runs (across Linux, macOS, Windows,
etc.), with only a small set of external requirements needed.

==== 📝 LSP Server Auto Configuration (nvim-lspconfig)

Language servers are configured and initialized using `nvim-lspconfig`.
"Capablities" comes from `cmp-nvim-lsp`. It tells the language server what
features `nvim-cmp` adds to the editor.

Then it creates an autocommand on the event LspAttach. This autocommand will be
triggered every time a language server is attached to a buffer. This is where
all keybindings and commands are created.

Here, I have implemented the following autocompletion behaviour:

* Autocompletion suggestions keep popping while typing
* If the suggestion box is visible, you can do the following
* Select Next entries with: `TAB`, `C-n`
* Select Previous entries with: `S-TAB`, `C-p`
* Accept an entry with `CR` / `RET`

🤔 Maybe VSCode like `DOWN` to select and `TAB` to complete might be better?

==== 🏃 Code Auto Completion (nvim-cmp)

The following Auto completion are available:

* Commandline Autocompletion `:`
* System Path Autocompletion `./`
* Buffer Text based Autocompletion
* Snippet based Autocompletion
* LSP based Autocompletion

* Tabstops
* Text-Transformations using Lua functions
* Conditional Expansion
* Defining nested Snippets
* Filetype-specific Snippets
* Choices

* Easy Postfix Snippets
* Parse LSP-Style Snippets directly in lua as a vscode package
* Expand LSP-Snippets with nvim-cmp (requires cmp_luasnip)
* Snippet history (jump back into older snippets)
* Resolve filetype at the cursor using Treesitter

=== Extra Packages
